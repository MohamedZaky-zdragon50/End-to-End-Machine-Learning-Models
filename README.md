# Machine Learning Models Showcase 🤖📊

A comprehensive machine learning project that demonstrates the application of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on real-world datasets.  
The project covers **Regression, Classification, and Clustering** models, each implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook following a complete machine learning workflow.

---

## 🖼️ Project Overview

This project focuses on applying different machine learning algorithms to solve three distinct problems:

- Predicting continuous values using **Regression**
- Predicting categorical outcomes using **Classification**
- Discovering hidden patterns in data using **Clustering**

Each notebook includes:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature scaling and transformation
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization and interpretation of results
